To demonstrate DP, we protect the user from something called Membership Inference Attack(MIA).

The idea behing DP is we should not be able to identify the identity of an individual user.

To prove that, we are going to take a database and create two copies of it such that they differ in only one record. Or exactly one record is absent from the original Database.
